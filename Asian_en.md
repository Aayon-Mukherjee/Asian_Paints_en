If you get your home painted by a professional, they will fix any minor or major concerns, including waterproofing and weatherproofing, making sure any future wall concerns can be avoided completely.

**So if you want that a third party person should do the job for you, without your interfernce with some extra bucks from your pocket, then you should definitely go with Asian Paints otherwise not.**
